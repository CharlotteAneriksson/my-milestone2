## UX & UI
### What it is
1. **Possibility to write your own good night story**
    * An app that makes it possible to create and read a story for a good night sleep or just to have a nice time while its raining. 
    * Choices are given to you, enviroment, character and item. This will after selection create a story.
### Whom its for
1. **The Parent**
2. **All parents, sibblings or other family**
3. **Children**
    * Childen from age 2-7 years

#### User
1. **Make time for both technologies and familytime**
    * As a parent, no need to have good imagination anymore. Just open the app, get your child to select their favourit animal, enviroments and items and just with a click you have a story to read together.
    * When the creativity lack after a hard day at work.
    * When you wanna use todays technologies but still wanna give what you got when you were a kid.
    * No need to think all screens are bad. They are not all bad, just use them for the right reasons.
2.  **The Child**
    * Learning to read.
    * Get activated in a calm, yet playful way. 
    * They wake up in the middle of the night and dont wanna wake up mom and dad, they can just read a story

#### Developer
1. **For fun**
    * Just for fun or for you own children. Create a game or other fun stuff you can later use with your kids or give away to others.
2. **To grow creativity**
    * Create color, graphic cartoons or just make up a game that doesnt excist.
3. **To practice JavaScript**
    * Maybe my JS can be written more simple? Or the logic can be written with other JS logic? 
4. **To practice mobileFirst**
    * Today most people visits the internet with their mobilephones. The statistics are very high, check it out [for Sweden](https://2017.svenskarnaochinternet.se/allmant-om-utvecklingen/internet-i-mobilen/)
    * The importance of mobilefirst is very great if you wanna grow the range of visitors or users.

### Design
1. **UX User Experience**
    * My UX is made to be simple and easy to understand even for the youngest of children useing the App. 
    * Photos are well thought out, they are there to create feelings and well thought out connections.
      * **bg1** 
      This is a laughing little happy boy. He reminds med of laughter and loads laughter. Pure happienss, that kind that only a kid has.
      * **bg2** 
      Two friends, two sibblings are together reading a story. The picture reminds me of building relationships and trust.
      * **bg3** 
      Reminds me and my brothers kids of a cosy cabbin built with cushions and bedsheets hihi. So cozy!
    * Along side with the pictures i chose to create vector graphic in Adobe Illustrator. Tried to create playful and simple graphics that every child could relate to somehow and the characters are created with a smile. Maybe a butterfly cant wear boots for us adults but for a child they can. Playful imagination is important.
2. **Colors** 
    <p align="center">

    </p>
  * Purple
    Purple is the color of the devine. Back in the days it was a royal color that today might bring up feeling like royalty, spiritual, mysterious and intelligent.

      <img width="300" height="100" src="assets\colors\color3.jpg" alt="green color">
    </p>
  * Green 
    Has a calming and refreshing effect and its the most kind to the eye. Is a symbol for nature and could induce feelings like analytical, calm, wealth and pure.

3. **Fonts**
  * *font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;*
    * This font is used in the information text do to the more seriousness of that text. It's ment to be read by parents and its a font you usually see in instuctional texts.
  * *font-family: 'Fredoka One', cursive;*
    * This is the main font of the page. Its a font with roundness in style, eazy to read ability and its usually seen in kids books, games and apps do to its playfulness.
